Project Submission files and descriptions:

1. OSM Project Submission file (.pdf and .html)
	- This is the primary "narrative" piece of my submission. I walks the reader
	through all parts of the project including auditing, cleaning, developing .csv files,
	creating a SQL database and SQL queries and analysis. Please note that the .html file 
	is much cleaner and easier to read as the .pdf conversion from Jupyter Notebook was not
	working so I could only print to .pdf. But I included the .pdf version as it was 
	specified in the submission document.
2. Python Auditing Code (.py)
	- This is all my raw code from the python cleaning and auditing phase of the project
3. Python Cleaning Code (.py)
	- This is the comprehensive cleaning code that takes the OSM file and creates the
	five .csv files needed for the SQL database.
4. SD_Sample3 (.osm)
	- This is my sample .OSM file
5. OSM Map Link and Resources (.txt)
	- This contains my link to where I got the OSM XML data and some of the websites and
	forums I used developing my project sumission.
